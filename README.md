<h3>Lab 1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Designing a simple lexical analyzer
    <ul>
      <li>The file <b>lexical_analyzer.cpp</b> has the code of a simply designed lexical analyzer.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Bonus: Use Flex to automatically create the lexer
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>Lexer.l</b> file is where I created a lexer using flex. I compiled the file, built the lex file using <b>"gcc lex.yy.c -o Lexer.l"</b> and then executed the program.</li>

 </ul>
 
 <h3>Lab 2</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the output of a scanner

      <li>The output that is described is taken from the lexical analyser designed in Lab 1. The description is in the <b>Description.doc</b> file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bonus: Download and use Flex in any way
     <ul>
      <li>I used flex to create a Hello World program, as seen in the <b>Hello_world.l</b> file. It was built and executed hence the <b>lex.yy.c</b> file and the <b>Hello_world.exe</b> program.  </li>
</ul>
